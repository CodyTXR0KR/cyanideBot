TODO Next
=========

**Priority**

- Comply with one function = one reponsibility principal

- Comment the code

- Write some useful unit tests

**in no particular order**

- Rewrite input validation in first_run() logic

  + `KeyboardInterrupts broken, poor validation, etc.`

- Add checks throughout code for invalid/missing configurations
	
  + `right now only checking if the files EXIST on __init__`
